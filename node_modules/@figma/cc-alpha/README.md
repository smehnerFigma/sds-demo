# Figma CC Alpha

An experimental NPM package designed for sampling React development apps at runtime, collecting examples of rendered React components.
These examples are then used by Figma to establish a link between your implemented components and their original designs.
You must be enrolled in this alpha program to successfully use this package.

## Installation

```
npm install @figma/cc-alpha
```

then

```
import CodeConnect from "@figma/cc-alpha"

CodeConnect.init({
    apiToken: "xxx-xxxx"
    orgId: "xxxxxx"
})

React.render()
```

## Running
Start your development environment. If everything is set up correctly:
	•	A small Figma icon will appear in the bottom-right corner of your screen.
	•	Clicking the Figma icon will open additional options.
